<h1> Typeof operator </h1>
<p>The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.</p>

<p id = "findOutTypes"></p>

<h1>Null</h1>
<p>In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object. </p>
