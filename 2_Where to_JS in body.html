<!-- JS in BODY-->

<h2> Do you know what day is it today?</h2>
<p id="week"> Let's find out...<p>

<button type="button" onclick="friday()"> Click here </button>
 
<script>
function friday() {
document.getElementById ("week").innerHTML= "It's Sunday!"
}
</script>

<p>It is a good idea to place scripts at the bottom of the <body> element.
This can improve page load, because HTML display is not blocked by scripts loading.</p>
